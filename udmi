go/udmi-writeback-spec


## Objective

This document outlines the specifications of an Universal Device Management Interface used for controlling a device. The objective of this document is to:



*   Describe the UDMI specification for cloud to device control.
*   Detail the cloud-side requirements that drive the above specification.
*   Provide detailed JSON examples of the specification.


### Related Reading



*   The [Universal Device Management Interface (UDMI)](https://github.com/faucetsdn/udmi) provides a high-level specification for the management and operation of physical IoT systems.
*   [IoT Cloud Gateway Requirements ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AUSejAesaV5VYxI2WREgqhmYu6Xaye4uW6153iOV5s8/edit#heading=h.pd5r47kqb6h9)


## Terminology 

**Device state**, sent from device to cloud, defined by [state.json](https://github.com/faucetsdn/udmi/blob/master/schema/state.json). There is one current state per device, which is considered sticky until a new state message is sent. It comprises several subsections (e.g. system or pointset) that describe the relevant sub-state components.

**Device config**, passed from cloud to device, defined by [config.json](https://github.com/faucetsdn/udmi/blob/master/schema/config.json). There is one active config per device, which is considered current until a new config is received.

State **status** is additional detail about the entity at the pointset level.



*   should provide additional human-readable detail about the current state of the point (e.g. explaining invalid, failure, overridden conditions)
    *   [Log-level conventions apply](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry#logseverity), indicating the overall severity of the condition (info, warning, error, etc...)

A **value\_state** indicates how the value is being determined. 

**Updating** boolean, a state-level field, indicates "things are being updated, please wait".



*   If the operation takes a few seconds this should be set immediately on receipt of a valid config.

A **pointset** is the set of points to be reported on in pointset telemetry/state



*   Device points not in pointset config should be ignored.
    *   A device may have 1,000 points but the cloud only cares about 2 points. So the pointset only reports 2 points in **[state](#bookmark=kix.6pardz53ymm2)** instead of 1,000 points.

Within the status block, the **message** field should be a one-line representation of the triggering condition.

The status **detail** field can be multi-line and include more detail, e.g. a complete program stack-trace.

The status **category** field is a device-specific representation of which sub-system the message comes from. In a Java environment, for example, it would be the fully qualified path name of the Class triggering the message.

A status **timestamp** field should be the timestamp the condition was triggered, or most recently updated. It might be different from the top-level message timestamp if the condition is not checked often or is sticky until it's cleared.

The status **level** should conform to the numerical Stackdriver [LogEntry levels](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry#logseverity). The DEFAULT value of 0 is not allowed (lowest value is 100, maximum 800).


## Cloud Requirements

Several requirements are driving the UDMI specification from the cloud side. These requirements are:



*   The ability for the cloud to specify the value for a point.
*   The ability to determine how a point's value is currently determined. 
*   The ability to determine whether a specific config update is currently applied. 
    *   Additionally, there should be a timeout for how long the system attempts to apply a config update.
*   If a config update fails, the ability to determine the reason for the failure, and to distinguish the failure by these three categories:
    *   device-side failure, e.g. hardware failure
    *   cloud-side failure, e.g. invalid config
    *   retryable later, e.g. higher-priority system is overriding the update


## UDMI Specification

The specification for cloud to device control adds several new fields to UDMI’s existing schemas for state and config.


### Config Fields

Two new fields are added to the config at the pointset level. First, `set_value`, which tells the device what value a given point should be set to. Second, `etag`, is sent to avoid race conditions. For example, say the cloud thinks a device is using unit A for a given point, and sends a value in those units. While the config is in-transit the device changes to unit B. When the config reaches the device, the value is mistranslated as being unit B. To prevent this and similar situations, the config includes a device-generated etag that uniquely represents the point’s state. If the config-sent `etag` doesn’t match the point’s etag at the time of receiving the config, then the device should set an “invalid” `value_state` in the state message (described below).

An example of these fields in use is 

<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>  GDC alert: undefined internal link (link text: "here"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>> </span></p>

[here](#heading=h.t8579d6t47wg).


### State Fields


#### State-Level Fields

One field for state is added at the top level, `etag`. As briefly described above, `etag` is a value that uniquely represents the state message. The purpose of this field is to prevent race conditions that arise when the cloud sends a config based on stale state information. If the device receives a new config from the cloud where the `etag` in the config doesn’t match the `etag` in the state, then an invalid `value_state` should be returned for all points that the cloud tried to write to. See the 

<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>  GDC alert: undefined internal link (link text: "etag example"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>> </span></p>

[etag example](#heading=h.hrorfmpvzcf).


#### Point-Level Fields

One new field for state is added at the pointset level, `value_state`. `value_state` is an enum representing the status of the point’s writeback attempt.

Possible states for `value_state`:



*   _ <missing>_ -- The `value_state` field is missing from this point. This means one of two things:
    *   The device is sending telemetry specified by the device as per normal operation. This is the more likely case.
    *   The point’s config is invalid, i.e. does not follow the UDMI spec. E.g. instead of specifying a `set_value`, the config specified `fix`,` `which isn’t a valid field in UDMI.
*   _applied_ -- The cloud value is applied to the device point. The point should now be reporting the value defined in the device’s config.
*   _updating_ -- The system is working to make the device state match the requested config, similar to the reconciling field in go/declarative-friendly-apis.
    *   If the system hasn’t reconciled the config within 5 seconds or before the next telemetry message (whichever comes first), then the system should send a state message with `value_state` set to `updating.`
    *   While the system should never abort trying to reconcile the config, eventually the system should report a failure in the `value_state`.
    *   The time it takes to reach this failure state is left up to the implementation, and should be documented clearly by the manufacturer.
*   _overridden_ -- The device point has been superseded by another system/user with a higher priority. 
*   _invalid _-- The system failed to apply the cloud value to the point because the requested value cannot be applied to the point. This state indicates an error on the cloud side. Some examples:
    *   Point is not writable
    *   Requested value is out of the operating bounds of the point
*   _failure _-- The system failed to apply the cloud value to the point because an error occurred on the device side. This state indicates an error on the device side.

In the case of any of the error states (failure, invalid, overridden), the [status field](https://github.com/faucetsdn/udmi/blob/master/schema/state_pointset.json#L24) for the point should be populated to provide additional debugging information about the error.

### Examples


#### Config `set_value` example


```
{
  "version": 1,
  "timestamp": "2018-08-26T21:39:29.364Z",
   "etag": "abc",
  "pointset": {
    "points": {
      "return_air_temperature_setpoint": {
        "set_value": 21.1,  // Write the setpoint to 21.1
      }
    }
  }
}
```



#### State “normal telemetry” example


```
"system": {
  // … omitted fields
  "etag": "abc",
},
"pointset": {
  "points": {
    "nexus_sensor": {
       // … no "value_state" field indicates the device is sending telemetry as normal.
    }
  } 
}
```



#### State `updating` example


```
"system": {
  // … omitted fields
  "etag": "abc",
},
"pointset": {
  "points": {
    "nexus_sensor": {
      "value_state": "updating",  // indicates the system is reconciling the config for this point
    }
  } 
}
```



#### State `applied` example


```
"system": {
  // … omitted fields
  "etag": "abc",
},
"pointset": {
  "points": {
    "nexus_sensor": {
      "value_state": "applied",  // indicates the value is coming from the cloud.
    }
  }
}
```



#### State `failure` example


```
"system": {
  // … omitted fields
  "etag": "abc",
},
"pointset": {
  "points": {
    "nexus_sensor": {
      "value_state": "failure",  // indicates the value from the cloud could not be applied.
      "status": {
        "message": "Failure to communicate to device",
        "category": "state.pointset.points.config.failure",
        "timestamp": "2018-08-26T21:39:28.364Z",
        "level": 600
      }
    }
  }
}
```



#### `Etag` example

Messages below are sent in chronological order.

State message 1:


```
"system": {
  // … omitted fields
  "updating": false, 
  "etag": "abc", // the starting etag
},
"pointset": {
  "points": {
    "nexus_sensor": {
    }
  }
}
```


Config message 1:


```
{
  "version": 1,
  "timestamp": "2018-08-26T21:39:29.364Z",
  "etag": "abc", // use the etag from the first state message
  "pointset": {
    "points": {
      "nexus_sensor": {
        "set_value": 21.1,  // Write the point to 21.1
      }
    }
  }
}
```


State message 2 (sent by the device before the device receives config message 1):


```
"system": {
  // … omitted fields
  "updating": false, 
  "etag": "xyz", // etag change from "abc" indicates the point's state has changed
},
"pointset": {
  "points": {
    "nexus_sensor": {
    }
  }
}
```


State message 3 (sent by the device after the device receives config message 1):


```
"system": {
  // … omitted fields
  "updating": false, 
  "etag": "xyz",
},
"pointset": {
  "points": {
    "nexus_sensor": {
      "value_state": "invalid",  // invalid because the config etag "abc" didn't match "xyz"
    }
  }
}
```



### Change On Value (COV)

Some devices are configured to send new values only when the value changes (COV). COV and writeback interact in two main cases. First, if a point is written to by the cloud and the value is changed, the device should send an update for that point. This behavior is consistent with COV. The behavior also provides telemetry confirmation that the write succeeded, although this confirmation isn’t strictly necessary, since the device state can confirm that the write is successful. Second, if the point is not changed by the write, the device should not send an update for that point. As mentioned, the cloud can determine that the write was successful from the device state.


## Cloud Behavior

It’s non-obvious how the specification above fulfills the requirements set out at the beginning of this doc. This section makes that fulfillment clear.

   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Additionally, upon receiving a new config, the device should abandon trying to reconcile any previous config and instead reconcile the new config. Once the new config is applied at the point level (i.e. the `value_state` of the point is not `updating`) , any previous configs (pending or not) are invalidated.

**------------------- Notes & previous discussion below this line ---------------------------**


## UDMI Schema

UDMI JSON examples/schema which shows how the device control config should look in order to update the point nexus\_sensor to value 21.1:


```
{ // this is the config message 
  "version": 1,
  "timestamp": "2018-08-26T21:39:29.364Z",
  "system": {
    "min_loglevel": 500
  },
  "pointset": {
    "sample_limit_sec": 2,
    "sample_rate_sec": 500,
    "points": {
      "return_air_temperature_sensor": {
      },
      "nexus_sensor": {
        "set_value": 21.1  // new config value to the point
      }
    }
  }
}
```


UDMI state messages will be described in the section below. 


### UDMI Behavior

General invalid config or failures should be reported in the state system/statuses, e.g.



*   Could not parse config (invalid JSON)
*   General communication failure (not specific to any point)

Mode Enumeration:



*   _<empty> _
    *   telemetry is reporting data value as per normal operation
    *   config error
*   _invalid - some config or parameters are not possible by the device_
    *   the cloud ask something is in-existed on the device e.g:
        *   unknown point name configured (not recognized by device)
        *   impossible parameters (e.g. COV specified but not supported)
        *   requested value was out of bounds
    *   someone on the cloud side should look at what happened there
*   _failure - on device side_
    *   example:
        *   endpoint reported hardware error
        *   write operation was rejected by target system
        *   value could not be read (but communication was ok)
    *   someone should look at the device to figure out the issue
*   _applied_ indicates _set\_value_ has been applied successfully
*   _overridden_ indicates _set\_value_ has intentionally not been applied


#### 


#### New proposal:

This is from Keith’s comment.

Keep reconciling (trying to write to device)


##### **_remote\_value\*_** Enumeration:

<empty>: no write or config error

not\_allowed: invalid value for point // out of bounds/unknown point name configured ...

write\_failed: "permanent" error writing to device.  **Write will not be retried // who?**

overridden: something with a higher priority has superseded this value

applied: the cloud value is in use.  


##### state example:

 If I try to write to several points but one point isn't writable (invalid\_config) and the other fails because of some device error, what should the state look like?


```
system: {
	reconciling: false,
	// true because of parse_error_point
	config_parse_errors: true
}

pointset.points: {
	not_writeable_point: {
		remote_value: not_allowed

	device_ error_point: {
		remote_value: write_failed
	}

	parse_error_point:{
		remote_value: <empty>
	}
}
```


\* point level reconciling boolean 

\* change mode to remote\_value.

## Other thoughts


### Do we need a request Id or can we find a config by timestamp? 

This is from Keith’s comment:

_“...If failed, do we know what value was attempted?”_ 

Yes, the timestamp is an uid by functionality. 


### Config duration time

For the priority overridden, we may need to know when the priority gets expired. For example, if a higher priority user changes the temperature setpoint of a VAV device to 100F, it may take 15 min for the VAV device to increase the temperature for a room. If the higher priority user wants to keep the temperature in 3hours, the IoT system or the device needs to keep the duration information. This may be handled by UDMI or the upper level system.


### Message(?) Queue

Similarly, if a user tries to change a device’s config by a series of config requests, how do we know the current state responses to which request in the queue? From the definition of [state](#bookmark=id.s6zpypzdhit5), the state should always represent the recent config which should be the top request of the quere.

If the request is partly set, e.g a request contains two setpoints but in the returned state only one point is set successfully and the other is pending, what is the behavior of the queue? I assume the queue will wait until the pending turns to either success or failure. 


## Appendix


#### Pending

A device can not receive the config message for a temporary reason e.g.:



*   the device temporarily disconnects with network
*   All external connections are there (e.g. MQTT heartbeat works) but the desired effect is not there (config block does not effect change). This can happen, e.g., when some mechanism internal to the device hits a null pointer exception and is buggy (yes, this happens).

The device should attempt to set the field's value until either the writeback succeeds or permanently fails. This behavior is what makes the failure temporary instead of permanent, and lets clients (i.e. Carson) know whether a writeback request is complete or not.

Another useful example is [here](https://github.com/faucetsdn/udmi/blob/master/schema/state.tests/example.json#L33), which shows the state message that the device sends when a point is controlled by the device:


```
{ // this is the state message

    "firmware": {
      "version": "3.2a"
    },
    "last_config": "2018-08-26T21:49:29.364Z",

  },
